<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, <br>I'm Sundayz</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Ethical Hacker from France love coding in Python !</h3>

---

I have always been passionate about computer science and discovered programming through my experience in the financial markets, where I started by developing trading tools and algorithms.

I have a strong foundation in Python and web application development with Django, which led me to develop an interest in cybersecurity.

I'm now a BugBounty Hunter at HackerOne and YesWeHack.

I regularly practice on popular platforms, you can check out my profiles [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1349136) & [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/Sundayz).

I recommend [HackTheBox Academy](https://referral.hackthebox.com/mzw44UJ) to learn about cybersecurity !
